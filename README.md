# FBProphet-using-sklearn

One of the models I created during my first Data Science internship at Axa France. It is a very robust and general time-series prediction model using a piecewise linear modeling of the trend and fourier series and holiday events indicators to model seasonality.

This idea was an attempt to reproduce the Facebook Prophet model and improve it's training time.
